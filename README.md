# Getting Started
 - These instructions will help you set up the project on your device.
# Prerequisites
- Ensure that Python is installed. The version used for this project is 3.12.0.    


## Installation

- Install all the packages listed in the requirements.txt file using the following command:
  ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
    
## Configuration
1. **Setting up Google OAuth Credentials:**
    - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
    - Create a new project or select an existing project.
    - Navigate to the **APIs & Services > Credentials** page.
    - Click on **Create Credentials** and select **OAuth 2.0 Client ID**.
    - Configure the consent screen and add the necessary scopes.
    - Set the application type to **Web application**.
    - In the **Authorized redirect URIs** section, add the following URIs:
      
    - For your deployed project (replace `your-deployed-project.com` with your actual domain):

        ```
        https://your-deployed-project.com/google_sign_in
        ```
    - Save the changes and note down the `client_id` and `client_secret`.

2. **Setting up Emailjs credentials::**
    - Go to Emailjs Dashboard
        - If you don't have an account sign up and log in
        - Once logged in create a new service or select an existing one
    - Retrieve your service ID
      - In the email services section, you will find the service ID, copy that ID
    - Create or select a template
      - Go to the templates section 
      - Either create a new template or update an existing one 
      - Note down the template ID
    - Get your public key
      - Navigate to the Account > API Keys section
      - copy your Public key
    - Update the values in the .env_sample file

3. **Setting up Environment Variables:**
    - Rename the `.env_sample` file to `.env`.
    - Open the `.env` file and fill in the following values:
      ```env
      CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
      CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
      SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
      EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your-public-key
      EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your-service-id
      EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your-template-id
      ```
    - Ensure that `SECRET_KEY` is a strong, random value. You can generate one using Python:
      ```python
      import os
      secret_key = os.urandom(24)
      print(secret_key)
      ```
4. **Adding Redirect URI in `app.py`:**
    - Open the `app.py` file.
    - Locate line 55 
    - Replace the placeholder(Your_redirect_uri) with your actual redirect URI. For example:
      ```
      redirect_uri = 'https://your-deployed-project.com/google_sign_in'
      ```
    - Make sure this URI matches the one set in your Google Cloud Console.         
## Usage
- During the sign-up process, you will be redirected to a registration page where you need to select a role [Admin, User, Interviewer].
- As an Admin, you will have access to the `config.py` file, where you can change the contents of dropdown filters.
